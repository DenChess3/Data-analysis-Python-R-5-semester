# Data-analysis-Python-R-5-semester
The final task of the computer practicum on data analysis on Python and R.
Task implementation in the Taskspy.ipynb and TaskRMD.Rmd files. The remaining files are datasets with data.

Tasks:
  1. Implement the approximation of data distributions using
nuclear estimates.
  2. Implement data analysis using cdplot, dotchart, boxplot and
stripchart.
  3. Check whether the observations are outliers from the point of view
of the formal statistical criteria of Grubbs and the Dixon Q-test.
Visualize the results.
  4. Use the tools to fill in the gaps in
the data. Make the omissions manually and compare the filling results with
the true values.
  5. Generate data from a normal distribution with different
to carry out the analysis using graphs of empirical
distribution functions, quantiles, the envelope method, as well as standard procedures
for testing hypotheses about normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ShapirOilka, Anderson-Darling, Kramer von Mises, Kolmogorov-Smirnov
criteria modified by Lilliefors and Shapiro-Francia). Consider samples of small
(no more than 50-100 elements) and moderate (1000-5000 observations) volumes.
  6. Demonstrate an example of data analysis using
quantile graphs, the envelope method, as well as standard hypothesis testing procedures
about normality. Consider samples of small and moderate volumes.
  7. Demonstrate the application of the following criteria for testing various hypotheses and
different confidence levels (0.9, 0.95, 0.99):
    a. Student, including one-sided variants, when
the null hypothesis being tested is that one of the compared
averages is greater (or less) than the other. Implement the evaluation
of the power of criteria for a given sample size or determining
the sample size to achieve a given power;
    b. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (ranked);
    c. Fischer, Levene, Bartlett, Fliegner-Kilin (testing
hypotheses about homogeneity of variances).
  8. To investigate correlational relationships in data using
Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients.
  9. To demonstrate the use of chi-square methods,
Fisher's exact test, McNemar test, Cochran-Mantel-Hensel.
  10. Check for multicollinearity in the data using
the correlation matrix and the variance inflation factor.
  11. Investigate the dependencies in the data using variance
analysis.
  12. Adjust regression models (including nonlinear ones) to
data, as well as to evaluate the quality of such an approximation.
